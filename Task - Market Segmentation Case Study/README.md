# Market Segmentation Analysis Case Study

This project focuses on applying various **market segmentation techniques** to analyze consumer behavior and identify distinct market segments. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering algorithms, and profiling, we derived insights to optimize marketing strategies for different target segments.

## Project Overview

Market segmentation is essential for identifying distinct consumer groups and tailoring marketing efforts to their specific needs. In this project, we explored different market segmentation techniques using real-world data, focusing on:

- **Clustering algorithms** (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Segment profiling and visualization**
- **Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis**

## Steps of Market Segmentation

1. **Commitment to Market Segmentation**  
   - Detailed analysis on the implications of segmenting markets, including long-term organizational changes and strategic investments.

2. **Segment Evaluation**  
   - Using criteria like segment size, growth potential, and competitive advantage, we evaluated potential target segments and identified key knock-out criteria.

3. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Data was sourced from various internal and external sources. We cleaned and prepared the data, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Initial exploration of data using summary statistics, visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, and box plots), and relationship checks between variables. This helped us identify underlying patterns and prepare data for clustering.

5. **Clustering Techniques**  
   - **K-Means Clustering**: Partitioning method used to group similar observations based on selected variables.  
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Employed to visualize the grouping of data points, using dendrograms to assess segment numbers.
   - **PCA**: Applied for dimensionality reduction to retain key features and minimize complexity in high-dimensional data.

6. **Profiling Segments**  
   - Each identified segment was profiled based on key characteristics using visualizations. This step helped in understanding the unique attributes of each segment and how they differ from one another.

7. **Target Segment Selection**  
   - Knock-out criteria were applied to eliminate segments that were not viable. The remaining segments were then evaluated for attractiveness and aligned with organizational objectives.

8. **Customizing the Marketing Mix**  
   - Tailored marketing strategies were developed for each segment, focusing on product, price, promotion, and distribution adjustments based on segment needs.

9. **Evaluation & Monitoring**  
   - The segmentation strategy was continuously evaluated to ensure effectiveness. Metrics like segment growth, performance, and consumer feedback were tracked.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**: For data manipulation, clustering, and PCA.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization tools used for segment analysis.
- **R**: Additional clustering methods like bagged clustering and model-based clustering.
