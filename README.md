##  Projects

###  [AI Product/Service Ideation: LoftlyValue](https://github.com/abhishek-sriram/Feynn-Labs-Internship-2024/tree/main/Task%20-%20AI%20Product%20Ideation%20Prototyping)
This solo project involved conceptualizing *"LoftlyValue"*, an AI-powered real estate property valuation app. The app uses machine learning algorithms to estimate property prices, providing buyers, sellers, and investors with accurate real estate valuations. This solution can streamline property assessments globally, improving the decision-making process in real estate markets.

###  [Market Segmentation Case Study](https://github.com/abhishek-sriram/Feynn-Labs-Internship-2024/tree/main/Task%20-%20Market%20Segmentation%20Case%20Study)
In collaboration with a team, I conducted a comprehensive market segmentation study, applying Python-based algorithms like K-Means and PCA. The study explored key customer segments in various markets, offering strategic insights for targeted marketing efforts. This project highlighted the significance of data-driven decision-making in segmentation.

###  [EV Market Segmentation Analysis](https://github.com/abhishek-sriram/Feynn-Labs-Internship-2024/tree/main/Task%20-%20EV%20Market%20Segmentation)
In this project, my team and I performed an in-depth segmentation analysis of the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market. Using datasets from Kaggle and other sources, we applied unsupervised machine learning techniques, including PCA and K-Means clustering, to identify customer segments and product categories. This analysis provided valuable insights into market trends and potential business strategies for EV manufacturers.
