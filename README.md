## Tasks/Projects

### [AI Product/Service Ideation: LoftlyValue](https://github.com/abhishek-sriram/Feynn-Labs-Internship-2024/tree/main/Task%20-%20AI%20Product%20Ideation%20Prototyping)
This solo project involved conceptualizing *"LoftlyValue"*, an AI-powered real estate property valuation app. The app uses machine learning algorithms to estimate property prices, providing buyers, sellers, and investors with accurate real estate valuations. This solution can streamline property assessments globally, improving the decision-making process in real estate markets.

### [Market Segmentation Case Study](https://github.com/abhishek-sriram/Feynn-Labs-Internship-2024/tree/main/Task%20-%20Market%20Segmentation%20Case%20Study)
In collaboration with a team, I conducted a comprehensive market segmentation study, applying Python-based algorithms like K-Means and PCA. The study explored key customer segments in various markets, offering strategic insights for targeted marketing efforts. This project highlighted the significance of data-driven decision-making in segmentation.

### [EV Market Segmentation Analysis](https://github.com/abhishek-sriram/Feynn-Labs-Internship-2024/tree/main/Task%20-%20EV%20Market%20Segmentation)
In this project, my team and I performed an in-depth segmentation analysis of the Indian Electric Vehicle (EV) market. Using datasets from Kaggle and other sources, we applied unsupervised machine learning techniques, including PCA and K-Means clustering, to identify customer segments and product categories. This analysis provided valuable insights into market trends and potential business strategies for EV manufacturers.

### [CropSense AI - Revolutionizing Small-Scale Farming with Data-Driven Solutions](https://github.com/abhishek-sriram/Feynn-Labs-Internship-2024/tree/main/Task%20-%20CropSense%20AI)
This project focuses on developing **CropSense AI**, a data-driven crop management system designed to help small-scale farmers improve productivity through actionable insights. By collecting data on weather, soil conditions, and crop yields, we used machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor to predict crop yields and issue pest/disease alerts.

- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Key Contributions**: 
  - Data collection and preprocessing (cleaning, feature scaling, and encoding)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.)
  - Developed machine learning models for yield prediction and pest alerts

This system aims to empower farmers with real-time insights, helping them make informed decisions, optimize resources, and prevent crop failures.
