## Introduction 
As a part of the extensive market segmentation analysis, that my team and I carried out, we implemented market segmentaion strategies focusing only on the Electric Vehicle(EV) market in India using unsupervised machine learning algorithms in Python. 

## Market Segmentation Analysis
Market segmentation is one of the key building blocks of strategic marketing. Market segmentation is essential
for marketing success: the most successful firms drive their businesses based on segmentation.[1]

## Problem Statement
The following problem statement was assigned to us by our mentor: 

##### You are a team working under an Electric Vehicle Startup. The Startup is still deciding in which vehicle/customer space it will be develop its EVs.

##### You have to analyse the Electric Vehicle market in India using Segmentation analysis and come up with a  feasible strategy to enter the market, targeting the segments most likely to use Electric vehicles.

##### (CUSTOMER/VEHICLE/B2B) SEGMENTS: Apart from Geographic, Demographic, Psychographic, Behavioral segments,  teams can consider different CATEGORY of Segments for the Segmentation Tasks, based on AVAILABILITY OF DATA. Market Segmentation comes with wide scope of possibility and Segments created can change based on different datasets collected. "

## Procedure
We gathered multiple datasets from various popular sources including Kaggle. These datasets covered diverse information of not only the consumers and customers of Indian EV market across different states in the country but also of the EV products launched today and in the past few years. 

To capture maximum information, each of the team members carried out their research to understand this business problem and presented their own set of questions to investigate into. These questions covered details of different EV market aspects with regards to it's costumers' information and products information. One or more datasets were assigned to each team member to perform EDA and extract information, by applying unsupervised methods such that they could answer the proposed  questions. This step of code implementation was individually performed. Our final results of analysis were compiled together. 

## Datasets
After laying down the business questions, we sought datasets that could closely answer all our questions. The following datasets were collected:

[Electric Vehicle 2023 (1)](kaggle/input/electric-vehicle-2023/smev_data.xlsx)

## Algorithms Used

* Heirarchical Clustering : Hierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis that seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. The results of hierarchical clustering[1] are usually presented in a dendrogram.
* Kmean Clustering : It aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.

These algorithms have helped us explore clusters of products and consumer categories.
